# Finding Bigfoot with JavaScript + Vector Search

This is the repository for a live stream where I using LangChain.js, Redis Vector Search, and assorted models to find Bigfoot using semantic search.

The stream is available at:

## Getting it Running

This is a work in progress so nothing solid here yet. However, the model file is too big to store in GitHubâ€”even if you use Git LFS. So, you'll need to download it yourself at:

More to come on how to get it running once I get it running myself!


If you are using an Intel-based Mac, you might need to change how Metal is installed. Details are [here](https://withcatai.github.io/node-llama-cpp/guide/Metal) but the magic command is:

```bash
npx --no node-llama-cpp download --no-metal
```


Start with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Embedder is not started by default. To start, use npm:

```bash
cd embedder
npm start
```

You can start as many of these as your CPU or GPU is happy to run. The will gladly run in parallel.
